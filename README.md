# Karate-Consumer-Contract-Demo

Client-side tests are housed in the [`consumer`](https://github.com/staffier/Karate-Consumer-Contract-Demo/tree/main/src/test/java/consumer) folder. 

Server-side mocks are housed in the [`provider`](https://github.com/staffier/Karate-Consumer-Contract-Demo/tree/main/src/test/java/provider) folder. 

Running the client-side tests will automatically launch the provider mock on an available port.
